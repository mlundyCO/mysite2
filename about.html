                <h2>About Me</h2> 
                 
                <p>I have been tutoring in person since 2008 and online since 2010, both at the high school and college levels. I encourage independence in students, emphasizing the motivation behind ideas, rather than rote memorization of formulas and equations. Born on the the East Coast, my family and I meandered to Colorado, where I completed Middle and High School. I majored in Applied Mathematics while competing for the varsity swim team at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. Now I am back in Colorado where I enjoy hiking, climbing, skiing, cycling and of course, math!</p>

                <h2>My Teaching Style</h2> 
                 
                <p>The art of solving problems extends beyond mathematics. While you may never directly apply a theorem from mathematics in your career, life is full of problems to be solved. In addition to the mathematical techniques necessary for your particular course, I strive to teach the general method of problem solving--a valuable, life-long skill that you will utilize long after you forget the fundamental theorem of calculus. The challenges of math apply directly to the challenges of life.</p>

<p>I have success applying this approach to a diverse set of students, from primary school to college to adult learners. One of the benefits of this approach is that it naturally adapts to different student's styles of learning. When a particular method for a problem does not work for you, I teach you how to find a method that does.</p>

<p>I try to avoid memorization. For any math course, there are some things that you just have to know, but much of the content may be quickly deduced from some core principals. I emphasize the fundamentals of the course, and how you may reason through some of the later results.</p>
